Merlin
======

####*"An ok name for a library"*


Merlin aims to simplify network monitoring by providing 3 registerable callbacks. 
`onConnect()` , `onDisconnect()` and `onBind(NetworkStatus networkStatus)`.

[Download the jar from here](https://github.com/novoda/merlin/raw/master/releases/merlin-core-v0.2.jar)

or if you're using Maven

*The repository is needed until the project is released on Maven Central, sorry about that*

##Usecases##

####`onConnect()`####

**When** the network state changes from disconnected to connected and a successful host ping has completed.

**Because** you have just aquired a valid network connection, time to update stale data!

####`onDisconnect()`####

**When** the network state changes from connected to disconnected.

**Because** you probably want to tell the user they're now offline! or disable certain functionality until a reliable connection is available again.

####`onBind(NetworkStatus networkStatus)`####

**When** the `MerlinService` has binded, the current `NetworkStatus` is provided, although this is without pinging a host. 

**Because** you may need to know the current state of the network before a network change occurs. 


##Setup

You'll need to add a few things to your manifest :

These permissions (if you don't already have them)

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
```

this service

```xml
<service android:exported="false" android:name="com.novoda.merlin.service.MerlinService" />
```

and this receiver

```xml
<receiver android:name="com.novoda.merlin.receiver.ConnectivityReceiver">
  <intent-filter>
    <action android:name="android.net.conn.CONNECTIVITY_CHANGE" />
  </intent-filter>
</receiver>
```

##Simple usage

Create Merlin (using `Merlin.Builder()`)

```java
merlin = new Merlin.Builder().withConnectableCallbacks().build(context);
```

Bind and unbind the service in your activity

```java
@Override
protected void onResume() {
    super.onResume();
    merlin.bind();
}

@Override
protected void onPause() {
    super.onPause();
    merlin.unbind();
}
```

Register for callbacks

```java
merlin.registerConnectable(new Connectable() {
        @Override
        public void onConnect() {
            // Do something!
        }
});
```
    
The [`MerlinActivity`](https://github.com/novoda/merlin/blob/master/demo/src/com/novoda/merlin/demo/presentation/base/MerlinActivity.java) within the demo shows a simple way to declutter Merlin from your main application code.
